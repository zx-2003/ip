## AI usage declaration

// chatGPT was used to explain details and concepts on some of the levels and provide suggestions on implementation
// for example one such usage was in Level 7 where I used it to figure out how to save files locally.
// It was also used to provide suggestions on how to implement the structure when I was re-organize classes.

// In addition it was used to explain how to integrate my CLI to GUI and provided explanation
// when I was unsure how to integrate certain features like how to restructure the logic required to run the app.

// chatGPT was used moderately overall.
